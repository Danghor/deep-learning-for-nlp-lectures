# Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing - Lectures 2021

This repository contains slides for the course "20-00-0947: Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing" (Technical University of Darmstadt, Summer term 2021)

The slides are available as PDF as well as LaTeX source code (I've used Beamer because typesetting mathematics in PowerPoint or similar tools is painful)
